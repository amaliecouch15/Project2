DNA Files
---------------
Sequencing reads for each of the cloned plasmids are avaliable in this repository. Each gene constructed was amplified by PCR, and cloned into a pCR 4 Blunt-TOPO vector for sequencing. From there, the gene construct was cloned into a pFBDM or pET17b plasmid for either insect or bacterial expression respectivley. 

Each folder contains .ab1 files for forwards and reverse sequencing reads, plus a .gb file of the expected code and a word document of an annotated DNA code. The files, except the word file, can be assembled in a program such as SeqMan Pro to assess the quality of sequencing. 

All the plasmids bellow were used to express the proteins stated. 

TOPO Plasmids:
* pASC_079 = TBK1 KD
* pASC_083 = ∆NPINK1
* pASC_084 = ∆NPINK1 KD
* pASC_088 = FRB-PINK1
* pASC_089 = FKBP-PINK1

pFBDM Plasmids:
* pASC_098 = ∆NPINK1
* pASC_099 = ∆NPINK1 KD
* pASC_100 = FKBP-PINK1
* pASC_101 = FRB-PINK1
* pASC_103 = TBK1 KD

pET17b Plasmids:
* pASC_109 = ∆NPINK1
